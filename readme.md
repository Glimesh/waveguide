# Waveguide
Waveguide is a _revolutionary_ live streaming facilitation server. Built around WebRTC it helps not only ingest video from many sources, but route that video around to various peers. Waveguide can be configured for a simple setup, or a out-of-the-box video streaming empire.

Waveguide is a very early work in progress.
